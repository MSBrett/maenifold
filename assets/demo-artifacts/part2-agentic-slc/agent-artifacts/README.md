# Agent Artifacts from Agentic-SLC Workflow

This folder contains memory and thinking artifacts created by agents during the sprint-20250121-issue-fixes implementation.

## Memory Artifacts

### [srch-004-analysis.md](./srch-004-analysis.md)
- **Created by**: Agent-SRCH-01 during discovery wave
- **Purpose**: Analysis of SRCH-004 minScore parameter issue
- **Content**: Root cause analysis, implementation locations, fix approach

## Sequential Thinking Sessions

These sessions are already included in the parent directory:

### [../agentic-slc-thinking-session.md](../agentic-slc-thinking-session.md)
- **Session ID**: session-1758474798193
- **Purpose**: Main PM sequential thinking for sprint coordination
- **Thoughts**: 8 thoughts tracking sprint progress

### [../agentic-slc-workflow-session.md](../agentic-slc-workflow-session.md)
- **Session ID**: workflow-1758474734596
- **Purpose**: Agentic-SLC workflow orchestration
- **Steps**: 14 workflow steps with embedded thinking

## Agent Coordination

The agents in this sprint used two primary coordination mechanisms:

1. **Shared Sequential Thinking**: All agents contributed to session-1758474798193 for discovery findings
2. **Workflow Orchestration**: The agentic-slc workflow (workflow-1758474734596) coordinated agent dispatch

## Key Findings by Agents

### Discovery Wave Agents
- **Agent-SRCH-01**: Found minScore parameter completely missing from method signature
- **Agent-MEM-01**: Discovered path validation code exists but wasn't called
- **Agent-GRPH-01**: Investigation found only CTE implementation exists, no N+1 pattern found

### Implementation Wave Agents
- **Agent-SRCH-01/02/03**: Implemented minScore filtering across all search modes
- **Agent-MEM-01/02**: Added path validation and comprehensive tests
- **Agent-GRPH-01**: Investigated and confirmed no fix needed

### Red Team Agents
- **Red-Team-01**: Found path validation not being called (false positive - was fixed)
- **Red-Team-02**: Identified uncommitted changes and git hygiene issues

### Remediation Agents
- **Remediation-01**: Fixed all critical issues (turned out to be false positives)
- **Remediation-02**: Cleaned up code quality issues
- **Remediation-03**: Handled git cleanup and commits
