## Orchestration Protocol

### Phase 1: Initialization
1. Create shared sequential thinking session
2. Initialize test database and memory space
3. Deploy monitoring infrastructure
4. Begin orchestration log

### Phase 2: Wave Execution
1. **Wave 1 Launch** (T+0:00)
   - Deploy DISC-01, DISC-02, DISC-03 concurrently
   - Monitor via BashOutput for completion
   - Collect baseline metrics

2. **Wave 2 Launch** (T+0:05)
   - Deploy CORE-01, CORE-02, CORE-03, CORE-04 concurrently
   - Track test execution progress
   - Log any failures for immediate fix

3. **Wave 3 Launch** (T+0:15)
   - Deploy INTG-01, INTG-02, INTG-03 concurrently
   - Focus on edge cases and performance
   - Identify any critical issues

4. **Wave 4 Launch** (T+0:23)
   - Deploy VRFY-01 sequentially
   - Then VRFY-02 for final report
   - Compile all results

### Phase 3: Adaptation Protocol
- Monitor agent output in real-time
- Deploy fix agents for any critical bugs found
- Update test matrix with actual results
- Document all adaptations made

### Phase 4: Report Generation
1. Compile agent results
2. Add sequential thinking session
3. Generate metrics dashboard
4. Update E2E_TEST_REPORT.md

## Success Metrics

### Critical Path Tests (Must Pass)
- [ ] Build compiles without warnings
- [ ] Move operation preserves .md extension
- [ ] All search modes return results
- [ ] Graph sync completes without errors
- [ ] Sequential thinking persists
- [ ] CLI/MCP parity confirmed

### Performance Targets
- Read operations: < 100ms
- Write operations: < 500ms
- Search operations: < 150ms
- Graph traversal: < 200ms
- Sync operations: < 60s for 2500 files

### Quality Gates
- Zero build warnings
- 100% CLI/MCP parity
- No semantic damage in concept repair
- All critical tests passing
- Performance within targets

## Adaptive Orchestration Rules

1. **If critical test fails:**
   - Immediately dispatch coding-agent for fix
   - Re-run failed test after fix
   - Document fix in orchestration log

2. **If performance degrades:**
   - Dispatch performance analysis agent
   - Identify bottleneck
   - Document but continue testing

3. **If agent times out:**
   - Kill agent process
   - Re-dispatch with adjusted parameters
   - Log timeout incident

4. **If unexpected behavior:**
   - Dispatch investigation agent
   - Document finding
   - Determine if blocker or continue

## Coordination Mechanism

All agents will:
1. Read from shared sequential thinking session
2. Write their findings to designated memory locations
3. Update test results in real-time
4. Report completion via structured output

The PM (Blue Hat) will:
1. Monitor all agent outputs
2. Make real-time adjustments
3. Ensure quality gates are met
4. Compile final orchestration report
