Thanks — this updated workflow looks good and follows GitHub Pages best practices. Summary of the important changes you made and a few checks / small suggestions:

What changed and why it’s good
- Trigger
  - Restricted to main only and added workflow_dispatch so you can run it manually.
- concurrency
  - Added to cancel in‑progress pages runs (helps avoid duplicate deployments).
- setup-node cache
  - Switched cache-dependency-path to site/package-lock.json (better cache key if you use a lockfile).
- configure-pages
  - Added actions/configure-pages@v5 — required by the Pages deployment flow to create the correct environment and artifacts.
- Install step
  - Now uses npm ci (no fallback). This is deterministic and preferable in CI if you have a lockfile.
- Upload / Deploy
  - Still uses actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3 and actions/deploy-pages@v4 as recommended.

Quick checklist (things to verify)
- Ensure site/package-lock.json actually exists. If you use yarn or pnpm, update cache-dependency-path accordingly.
- Confirm your Astro output directory is site/dist (Astro default is dist, so this is usually correct).
- Permissions: pages: write and id-token: write are present — required for deploy-pages. contents: read is fine.
- If your repo still has a master branch, removing it from the push trigger is fine if you only intend to use main.
- The environment url expression (${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}) is the pattern used in the Pages docs and will populate the environment URL after the deploy step runs.

Optional suggestions
- If you want to reduce noise from failed builds caused by transient npm registry errors, you could keep your original fallback (npm ci || npm i), but npm ci is better for reproducibility.
- If you want to pin more strictly, you can choose specific action major.minor versions, but @v4 / @v5 are common and reasonable.
- If you use a package manager other than npm, replace the install/build steps and cache path accordingly.

If you’d like, I can:
- Validate the workflow for any repo-specific differences (e.g., different lockfile or build output directory),
- Produce a final YAML with any optional suggestions applied.
