I compared the original project file and the updated one you provided — they are identical. No changes were applied.

If you intended to make a specific change, tell me what you want to update (for example: bump Version, add RepositoryType, set GeneratePackageOnBuild, change package versions, modify DefineConstants, add an assembly attribute, etc.) and I’ll produce the edited .csproj for you.
