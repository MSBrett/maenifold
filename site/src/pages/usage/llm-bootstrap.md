## Architecture: Thinking-First Cognitive System
Cognitive amplification system that combines structured reasoning, persistent memory, and knowledge graphs.

### Three Core Layers
1. **Thinking Layer**: Sequential thinking for complex analysis, workflows for structured processes
2. **Memory Layer**: Markdown files at ~/maenifold/memory/ accessed via memory:// URIs
3. **Graph Layer**: Entity relationships extracted from [[WikiLinks]] stored in SQLite

The system is "thinking-first" - complex tasks route through reasoning tools, which create persistent memories.

## Task Routing Decision Tree

### Complex Analysis or Multi-Step Tasks
- **SequentialThinking**: Multi-step reasoning with persistent session files
- **Workflow**: Structured orchestrated processes (28+ available workflows)

### Simple Operations
- **Direct tool calls**: Single operations on memory or graph

## Tool Categories

### Reasoning Tools (Primary Interface)
- **SequentialThinking**: Complex analysis with persistent thoughts
- **Workflow**: Structured processes like design-thinking, agentic-dev, critical-thinking

### Memory Tools (Use memory:// URIs)
- **WriteMemory**: Creates .md files with [[WikiLinks]] - Returns memory_uri
- **ReadMemory**: Reads files by memory:// URI or title
- **SearchMemories**: Full-text search - Returns memory_uri array
- **EditMemory** / **DeleteMemory** / **MoveMemory**: File operations

### Graph Tools (Accept [[Entity Names]])
- **BuildContext**: Traverses concept relationships around [[Entity]]
- **Visualize**: Generates Mermaid diagrams for [[Entity]] networks
- **Sync**: Extracts [[WikiLinks]] from files → populates graph

### System Tools
- **RecentActivity**: Shows recent thinking/memory activity
- **MemoryStatus**: System health and statistics

## Critical Requirements

### Task Complexity Routing
- **Complex/multi-step tasks**: Use SequentialThinking or Workflow FIRST
- **Simple single operations**: Use direct tools (memory/graph/system)
- **All thinking sessions**: Create persistent memory files automatically

### WikiLink Format Rules
- **Graph tools**: MUST use [[Entity Name]] format, NOT memory:// URIs
- **File tools**: MUST use memory:// URI format, NOT [[WikiLinks]]
- **Content creation**: MUST include [[WikiLinks]] or Sync won't extract entities
- **Thinking content**: MUST contain [[WikiLinks]] to build knowledge graph

### Success Patterns
1. **Complex task** → SequentialThinking/Workflow → creates memory://thinking/session-id.md
2. **Memory files with [[WikiLinks]]** → Sync → populates graph with entities
3. **Graph exploration** → BuildContext traverses [[Entity]] relationships
4. **Knowledge discovery** → SearchMemories returns memory:// URIs

## System Integration
- **Sync** bridges memory and graph layers by extracting [[WikiLinks]]
- **Thinking sessions** automatically persist to memory with [[WikiLinks]]
- **Graph is ephemeral cache**, memory files are source of truth
- **Always Sync after creating content** with new [[Entities]]
