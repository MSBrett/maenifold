## Step 8/17 Response

[[Implementation dispatch]] complete! All agents executed successfully. [[SRCH-004]]: minScore parameter fully implemented with filtering and tests. [[MEM-009]]: Path validation added with comprehensive security checks. [[GRPH-009]]: Investigation found only CTE implementation exists. Performance acceptable but complex traversals can timeout (30+ seconds). No optimization implemented. All [[regression tests]] created and passing.
