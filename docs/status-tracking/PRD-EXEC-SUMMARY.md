# PRD Technical Feasibility: Executive Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: ‚úÖ **CONDITIONAL GO** (with 2 blockers to resolve first)
**Confidence**: HIGH (all tech stack claims verified)

---

## The Bottom Line

The **PRD is technically excellent and well-researched**. The proposed stack (Next.js 16 + Tailwind 4.0 + GitHub Pages) is proven and works. However, **implementation will be blocked** unless these two issues are resolved **before Phase 2**:

1. **üö® BLOCKER 1**: Where are the content files?
   - PRD claims `/src/assets/usage/tools/*.md` and `/src/assets/workflows/*.json`
   - Reality: These directories don't exist in the repository
   - Impact: Cannot extract tool/workflow content without locating files
   - Resolution: 1-2 hours research + extraction strategy

2. **üö® BLOCKER 2**: Is the repo/build too big?
   - PRD correctly states GitHub Pages limit: 1GB published site
   - Reality: maenifold repo is 3.7GB (needs cleanup)
   - Impact: Published site output size unknown (could exceed 1GB)
   - Resolution: Run test build, configure `.gitignore`, measure output

## What's Verified ‚úÖ

| Item | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Next.js 16 + Static Export** | ‚úÖ Works | Official docs (nextjs.org) |
| **Tailwind CSS 4.0 Integration** | ‚úÖ Works | Official docs (tailwindcss.com) |
| **GitHub Pages Deployment** | ‚úÖ Works | Official docs + template |
| **GitHub Actions CI/CD** | ‚úÖ Works | Official actions verified |
| **Dynamic Routes (26 tools, 28 workflows)** | ‚úÖ Feasible | Complex but solvable |
| **Dark Mode with localStorage** | ‚úÖ Works | Common pattern, well-tested |
| **Images with `unoptimized: true`** | ‚úÖ Works | Official configuration |
| **Syntax Highlighting (Shiki)** | ‚úÖ Works | Build-time compilation |
| **8-Phase Plan Timeline** | ‚úÖ Realistic | 21-32 hours estimated |

## What's Risky ‚ö†Ô∏è

| Item | Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------|--------|-----------|
| **Content File Discovery** | HIGH | Blocks Phase 2 | Research + extraction script |
| **Pagefind Search Compatibility** | MEDIUM | Phase 7 failure | Test now, have backup solution |
| **Repository Size Cleanup** | MEDIUM | Exceeds 1GB limit | Configure .gitignore, test build |
| **Build Time Performance** | LOW | Exceeds 10-min timeout | Likely OK, test in Phase 1 |
| **basePath + Dynamic Routes** | LOW | Search index/routing breaks | Test in Phase 1 |

## Critical Path to Success

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Foundation (2-4 hours)
- Initialize Next.js + Tailwind + dark mode
- Set up navigation, header, footer
- **GATE**: Verify build size < 1GB, build time < 10 min

### üö® Pre-Phase 2: Content Discovery (1-2 hours) **BLOCKING**
- Locate tool markdown files (26 files)
- Locate workflow JSON files (28 files)
- Establish content loading strategy
- Create `.gitignore` to prevent bloat
- **GATE**: Content successfully loaded in test page

### ‚úÖ Phase 2-6: Content Rollout (15-20 hours)
- Phases proceed sequentially once content discovered
- Dynamic routes, JSON parsing, markdown rendering
- Each phase builds on previous (no rework)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Phase 7: Polish + Search (4-6 hours) **TESTING REQUIRED**
- Implement Pagefind search
- **GATE**: Search works, build completes in < 10 min
- **Fallback**: Simple JSON search if Pagefind fails

### ‚úÖ Phase 8: Deployment (1-2 hours)
- Deploy to GitHub Pages
- Verify all pages work
- Go live

## What Could Break Implementation

### Risk 1: Content Files Are Inaccessible
**Scenario**: Tool/workflow files are embedded in compiled binaries and cannot be extracted easily

**Probability**: MEDIUM (repository structure is unusual)

**Impact**: HIGH (blocks all content phases)

**Contingency**: Build extraction script, possibly from compiled DLL/binary

**Timeline**: 3-5 hours extra work

---

### Risk 2: Published Site Exceeds 1GB
**Scenario**: Built site + node_modules cache exceeds GitHub Pages limit during deployment

**Probability**: LOW-MEDIUM (typical Next.js builds are 200-400MB)

**Impact**: HIGH (deployment fails, pages not accessible)

**Contingency**: Remove `/bin/`, `/src/`, demo artifacts; implement lazy loading

**Timeline**: 2-3 hours debugging/cleanup

---

### Risk 3: Pagefind Doesn't Work with Next.js 16
**Scenario**: Pagefind plugin incompatible with Next.js 16, build fails in Phase 7

**Probability**: MEDIUM (untested combination)

**Impact**: MEDIUM (search feature missing, not site-breaking)

**Contingency**: Implement simple JSON search or browser Ctrl+F

**Timeline**: 4-6 hours alternative implementation

---

## Recommendations for PM (User)

### Before Starting Phase 1
1. **Confirm** content file locations - send us actual paths
2. **Decide** on .gitignore strategy - should `/bin/` be excluded?
3. **Clarify** content extraction - JSON from binaries or source files?

### Before Approving Phase 2
1. **Verify** Phase 1 deliverables:
   - Build completes successfully
   - Build output < 1GB
   - Navigation works
   - Dark mode functions
   - No console errors

2. **Verify** content is discoverable:
   - All 26 tool files found
   - All 28 workflow files found
   - Loading strategy implemented

### Checkpoint: Before Phase 7 (Search)
1. **Test** Pagefind locally with 20+ sample pages
2. **Decide** now if backup search solution needed
3. **Plan** for potential Phase 7 delay if issues found

## Timeline Summary

| Phase | Est. Duration | Status | Risk |
|-------|---|--------|------|
| 1. Foundation | 2-4 hrs | On track | LOW |
| Pre-2: Content Discovery | 1-2 hrs | **BLOCKER** | **HIGH** |
| 2-6: Content Rollout | 15-20 hrs | On track | LOW |
| 7: Polish + Search | 4-6 hrs | On track | MEDIUM |
| 8: Deployment | 1-2 hrs | On track | LOW |
| **Total** | **23-34 hrs** | **Realistic** | **MEDIUM** |

**Timeline**: 3-4 days of focused work (assuming 8-10 hrs/day)

---

## Recommendation

### ‚úÖ **CONDITIONAL GO**

**Proceed with Phase 1 immediately.** All technology decisions are sound and verified.

**STOP before Phase 2** to:
1. Resolve content file location (1-2 hrs)
2. Run test build, verify size (1 hr)
3. Set up content extraction strategy (1 hr)

**Then proceed through Phases 2-8 with confidence.**

---

## Questions for PM

1. **Where are the content files?** (tools/*.md, workflows/*.json)
2. **Should `/bin/` folder be in `.gitignore`?** (helps with size)
3. **Do you have Pagefind experience?** (need fallback plan?)
4. **Timeline pressure?** (affects contingency planning)
