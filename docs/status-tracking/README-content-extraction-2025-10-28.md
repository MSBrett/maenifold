## 2. "What maenifold does" Section
**Lines**: 9-31
**Content Type**: Section header + Core narrative + Demo story + Summary

```
Line 9:     ## What maenifold does

Line 10:    [blank line]

Line 11:    **maenifold** enhances AI agents with persistent graphs of thought
            that compound over time. Every tool creates `[[WikiLink]]`
            connections that survive conversations. Every session builds on the
            last. Knowledge compounds instead of resets. **It transforms
            ephemeral AI sessions into continuous collective intelligence.**

Line 12:    [blank line]

Line 13-15: <p align="center">
              <img src="assets/branding/graph.jpeg" alt="graph">
            </p>

Line 16:    [blank line]

Line 17:    [Our demo](assets/demo-artifacts/README.md) shows this at scale:
            25 AI agents across 68 minutes discovered a critical production
            bug not through programmed coordination, but through emergent
            understanding. No orchestration code was written, yet agents
            perfectly orchestrated themselves across 4 waves, building on
            each other's discoveries through a shared knowledge graph.

Line 18:    [blank line]

Line 19:    The critical move operation bug emerged from the intersection of
            multiple test patterns seen across different agent sessions -
            something no single agent could have found alone. This is
            maenifold's core: making every AI session additive rather than
            isolated.

Line 20:    [blank line]

Line 21:    ### How it worked:

Line 22:    [blank line]

Line 23-27: - Agents shared discoveries through `[[WikiLinks]]` in memory files
            - Each wave of agents built on previous findings via search and
              context traversal
            - The critical bug emerged from patterns across multiple test
              sessions
            - 171,506 new concept relationships were created, connecting
              discoveries
            - [Full orchestration logs](assets/demo-artifacts/part1-pm-lite/
              orchestration-session.md) and [test results]
              (assets/demo-artifacts/part1-pm-lite/E2E_TEST_REPORT.md)
              available

Line 28:    [blank line]

Line 29:    85% test success rate. Real production bug found. Zero
            orchestration code written.

Line 30:    [blank line]

Line 31:    That's what maenifold does: It provides the substrate (WikiLinks,
            memory, graph) and steps back. Intelligence fills the space.
```

**Status**: ‚úì Ready for copying to main features section
**Notes**:
- Contains embedded image reference: `assets/branding/graph.jpeg`
- Contains internal links to demo artifacts
- Rich narrative structure with subsection "How it worked:"
- Demonstrates value through concrete demo metrics

```
Line 33:    ## Cognitive Assets

Line 34:    [blank line]

Line 35:    maenifold ships with 54 pre-configured cognitive frameworks that
            agents can adopt dynamically:

Line 36:    [blank line]

Line 37:    ### üîÑ **28 Workflows** - Structured Methodologies
Line 38:    From reasoning patterns to development processes:
Line 39-43: - **Reasoning**: deductive, inductive, abductive, critical,
              strategic, higher-order thinking
            - **Creative**: design thinking, divergent thinking, lateral
              thinking, oblique strategies, SCAMPER
            - **Development**: agentic-dev with anti-slop controls, agile,
              SDLC, code review workflows
            - **Collaborative**: world caf√©, parallel thinking, six thinking hats
            - **Meta-orchestration**: workflow-dispatch for intelligent
              methodology selection

Line 44:    [blank line]

Line 45:    ### üé≠ **7 Roles** - Professional Perspectives
Line 46:    Each with personality, principles, and transition triggers:
Line 47-53: - **Product Manager**: "Simple, Lovable, Complete" framework
            - **Architect**: System design and patterns

            - **Researcher**: Investigation and discovery
            - **Writer**: Clear communication
            - **Red Team**: Security testing and adversarial thinking
            - **Blue Team**: Defense and protection strategies

Line 54:    [blank line]

Line 55:    ### üé® **7 Colors** - De Bono's Six Hats + Gray
Line 56:    Thinking modes for different cognitive approaches:
Line 57-63: - **White**: Facts and information
            - **Red**: Emotions and intuition
            - **Black**: Caution and critical judgment
            - **Yellow**: Optimism and positive assessment
            - **Green**: Creativity and alternatives
            - **Blue**: Process control and orchestration
            - **Gray**: Skeptical inquiry and assumption questioning

Line 64:    [blank line]

Line 65:    ### üó£Ô∏è **12 Perspectives** - Sapir-Whorf Linguistic Patterns
Line 66:    Language-influenced cognitive styles based on linguistic
            relativity:
Line 67-70: - **Arabic**: Pattern analysis through root systems
            - **Japanese**: Contextual and relational thinking
            - **German**: Hierarchical precision
            - **And 9 more**: Each language brings unique reasoning patterns

Line 71:    [blank line]

Line 72:    These aren't just templates - they're cognitive substrates that
            combine with the knowledge graph to create emergent reasoning
            capabilities. An agent can start with strategic thinking, switch
            to red team perspective when finding vulnerabilities, then adopt
            the writer role to document findings - all while building on the
            persistent knowledge graph.
```

**Status**: ‚úì Ready for copying to capabilities/features showcase
**Notes**:

- Total 54 frameworks (28 + 7 + 7 + 12)
- Ends with synthesizing explanation of how these combine with knowledge graph
- Content is highly structured with bullet lists
