# PRD Completion to 100%

**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Current Status:** 75% complete per scope gaps review
**Target:** 100% complete with all gaps filled using official documentation only

---

## Task

Close the 25% gap in the maenifold GitHub Pages site PRD by researching official documentation for all missing operational details and adding them to the PRD. No POC, no testing - only use officially documented functionality.

## Task Restated

I need to:
1. Research official Next.js documentation for 404 handling in static export mode
2. Research official GitHub Actions documentation for build failure handling
3. Research official tools/methods for link validation in static sites
4. Add specifications for 8 important gaps (content maintenance, versioning, search details, image strategy, mobile testing, accessibility, performance, content updates)
5. Update PRD with all findings using exact quotes and citations
6. Remove or replace any features that are not officially documented to work

**Assumptions:**
- Will ONLY use features documented in official sources
- Will NOT include any experimental or untested approaches
- Will cite every addition with official documentation URLs
- Will remove Pagefind if integration is not officially documented
- Will follow Ma Protocol: proof for everything

## Plan

### Phase 1: Research Critical Gaps (Official Docs Only)
1. Read Next.js official docs for 404.html in static export
2. Read GitHub Actions official docs for build failure handling
3. Research official link validation tools (if none exist, specify manual process)

### Phase 2: Research Important Gaps
4. Define content maintenance workflow
5. Specify versioning approach (Last Updated dates)
6. Detail search result presentation
7. Specify image optimization strategy for static export
8. Detail mobile testing approach
9. Detail accessibility audit process
10. Define performance monitoring approach
11. Address content versioning

### Phase 3: Update PRD
12. Add all findings to PRD with citations
13. Remove any undocumented features
14. Verify 100% completion against scope gaps review

## Status

### Phase 1 Complete: Research Findings

**Agent 1 - Next.js 404 Handling**: ✅ FULLY DOCUMENTED
- Pages Router automatically generates 404.html with `output: 'export'`
- Create `pages/404.js` and Next.js handles the rest
- Source: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports

**Agent 2 - GitHub Actions Failure Handling**: ✅ FULLY DOCUMENTED
- Complete failure handling with `continue-on-error`, status checks, recovery workflows
- Email notifications with failure-only filtering
- Manual re-runs via UI and CLI
- Source: https://docs.github.com/en/actions

**Agent 3 - Link Validation**: ⚠️ MIXED RESULTS
- Next.js `typedRoutes: true` for internal links (officially documented)
- W3C Link Checker for external validation (official W3C tool)
- NO official GitHub Action exists for link validation
- Source: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/typescript

**Agent 4 - Pagefind Integration**: ❌ NOT DOCUMENTED FOR NEXT.JS 16
- Only community resources exist for Next.js 13-15
- Static export mode works (v1.0.0+) but Next.js 16 integration undocumented
- User requirement: "Either it works and is documented or we don't use it at all"
- **DECISION REQUIRED**: Remove Pagefind or find documented alternative

### Current Status: Search Solution Decision

Per user directive: No POC, no testing. Only officially documented functionality.

**Research Results:**
- Pagefind + Next.js 16: NOT documented
- Next.js official guidance on static search: DOES NOT EXIST
- Next.js static export docs: SILENT on search functionality

**Decision:** REMOVE SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY FROM PRD

Reasoning:
1. Pagefind integration with Next.js 16 is undocumented
2. Next.js provides zero official recommendations for static site search
3. User requirement: "Either it works and is documented or we don't use it at all"
4. Ma Protocol: No assumptions, no untested integrations

Search will be moved from WILL build to WON'T build section.

### Phase 2: Updating PRD to 100%

Now proceeding to update PRD with:
- ✅ 404 handling (officially documented)
- ✅ Build failure recovery (officially documented)
- ✅ Link validation (Next.js typedRoutes + W3C Checker)
- ❌ Search functionality (REMOVED - undocumented)
- 8 important operational details

### Phase 2 Complete: PRD Updated

**Additions Made:**
1. **Removed search** from WILL build (9 locations)
2. **Added search to WON'T build** with rationale (Pagefind + Next.js 16 undocumented)
3. **Added Section 23: 404 Error Handling** with official Next.js quotes
4. **Added Section 24: Build Failure Recovery** with GitHub Actions documentation
5. **Added Section 25: Link Validation** with Next.js typedRoutes and W3C Link Checker
6. **Added Section 26: Content Maintenance Workflow**
7. **Added Section 27: Content Versioning** (Last Updated dates from Git)
8. **Added Section 28: Image Optimization Strategy** (static images, manual compression)
9. **Added Section 29: Mobile Testing Plan** (breakpoints, devices, scenarios)
10. **Added Section 30: Accessibility Audit Process** (WCAG 2.1 AA, tools, checklist)
11. **Added Section 31: Performance Monitoring** (Lighthouse CI, metrics, budgets)
12. **Added Section 32: Content Update Process** (workflow, rollback, automation)

### Phase 3: Adding Research Document References

Now adding all research documents to References section...

### Phase 3 Complete: References Updated

**Added 5 new reference sections:**
1. **Section 5**: Next.js 404 Error Page Handling (nextjs-404-handling-static-export.md)
2. **Section 6**: GitHub Actions Build Failure Handling (github-actions-failure-handling.md)
3. **Section 7**: Link Validation Methods (link-validation-research-findings.md)
4. **Section 8**: Pagefind + Next.js Integration (pagefind-nextjs-integration.md) - NOT DOCUMENTED
5. **Section 9**: Next.js Official Search Guidance (nextjs-official-search-guidance.md) - DOES NOT EXIST

All references include:
- Document name
- Primary source URLs
- Date accessed
- Key topics
- Relevant quotes cited in PRD
