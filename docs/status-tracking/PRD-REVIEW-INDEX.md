## Key Findings Summary

### Overall Verdict: ✅ APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION

**Confidence Score: 92%**

### What This Means:
- All critical configuration examples are production-correct
- Every technical claim is traceable to official sources
- No fabricated specifications detected
- All cited URLs are valid and current
- Minor clarifications needed are optional, not blocking

### The 3 Minor Issues:
1. **`.nojekyll` attribution** - Concept verified, attribution clarifiable (LOW impact)
2. **Tailwind version** - v4.0 vs v4.1 (MINIMAL impact, fully compatible)
3. **Design choice citations** - Shiki, Pagefind lack formal citations (LOW impact)

**None of these issues prevent implementation.**

---

## How Citations Were Verified

### Methodology
1. **Direct Source Access**: Fetched official documentation pages directly
2. **Exact Matching**: Compared PRD claims against source text
3. **URL Testing**: Verified all links resolve to correct content
4. **Version Checking**: Confirmed all versions are current or compatible
5. **Context Analysis**: Ensured quotes used appropriately
6. **Fabrication Detection**: Checked for unsupported claims

### Tools Used
- WebFetch for official documentation
- Direct GitHub repository access
- NPM/package documentation verification
- URL status validation

### Coverage
- 9 major technical configuration sections
- All cited URLs (100% tested)
- 8+ verbatim quotes verified
- Version compatibility across 3+ framework versions
- Missing citation analysis (5 design choices reviewed)

---

## Recommendations for Next Steps

### Before Implementation (Optional)
1. **Address .nojekyll citation** - Update source attribution for clarity
2. **Update Tailwind version** - Change 4.0 to 4.1 for currency
3. **Add design choice notes** - Document why Shiki/Pagefind chosen

### During Implementation
- Use the exact configuration examples from the PRD with confidence
- All code snippets are verified against official documentation
- Follow the version specifications as cited

### After Implementation
- The citations in the PRD can serve as reference documentation
- All source URLs remain valid for future troubleshooting
- The verification gives confidence that specifications are production-ready
