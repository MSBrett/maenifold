**Mitigation**:
- [ ] Add explicit timeouts and retry logic to workflow
- [ ] Implement fallback: deploy previous version on timeout
- [ ] Log all build metrics for debugging
- [ ] Have manual deployment guide

**Verdict**: Requires proactive workflow design

---

### Scenario 5: Dark Mode Doesn't Persist (localStorage Issue)
**Probability**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: MEDIUM (UX regression)

**Scenarios**:
- ✗ Private browsing blocks localStorage
- ✗ Browser doesn't support localStorage
- ✗ Dark mode value lost on page reload

**Mitigation**:
- [ ] Test localStorage in private mode
- [ ] Implement fallback: prefer-color-scheme media query
- [ ] Add feature detection test
- [ ] Log localStorage issues for debugging

**Verdict**: Requires careful implementation and testing

## Contingency Plans

### Contingency 1: Build Time Exceeds 10 Minutes
**Trigger**: Build > 9 minutes in Phase 1
**Action**:
1. Profile build with Chrome DevTools
2. Identify bottleneck (content extraction, search, export)
3. Options:
   - Parallel page generation
   - Incremental builds
   - Pre-generate at different time
   - Accept longer build, use scheduled deployments

---

### Contingency 2: Pagefind Search Doesn't Work
**Trigger**: Search index fails to generate in Phase 7
**Action**:
1. Switch to client-side search (lunr.js or flexsearch)
2. Reduced search scope (titles/descriptions only)
3. Fallback: no search (users navigate manually)

---

### Contingency 3: Lighthouse Score < 90
**Trigger**: Phase 7 Lighthouse test < 90
**Action**:
1. Code split large pages
2. Lazy load search
3. Compress images further
4. Defer non-critical JavaScript
5. Accept < 90 if core UX acceptable

---

### Contingency 4: GitHub Pages Deployment Fails
**Trigger**: GitHub Actions workflow fails on Phase 8
**Action**:
1. Manual deployment: download artifact, push via git
2. Investigate workflow error logs
3. Fix and re-run
4. Have documented manual deployment steps

---

### Contingency 5: DNS/Custom Domain Issues
**Trigger**: Custom domain doesn't resolve after 30 min
**Action**:
1. Verify CNAME in GitHub Pages settings
2. Check DNS propagation (use mxToolbox)
3. Wait up to 24 hours (TTL propagation)
4. Fallback: use github.io domain
5. Retry custom domain after propagation
