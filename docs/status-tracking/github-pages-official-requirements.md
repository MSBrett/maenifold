## 1. Core Definition and Static File Support

### GitHub Pages Accepts Plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript

**EXACT QUOTE**: "GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website."

**Source**: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/what-is-github-pages
**Accessed**: 2025-10-28

**Key Implication**: Plain static HTML/CSS/JS sites are fully supported. No build process required.

## 2. Repository Structure Requirements

### User/Organization Site Naming

**EXACT QUOTE**: "Sites associated with a user or organization account [...] Must be stored in a repository named `<owner>.github.io`, where `<owner>` is the personal or organization account name"

**Source**: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/what-is-github-pages
**Accessed**: 2025-10-28

**Additional Note on Casing**:
User/org sites must follow strict naming: "Any uppercase letters in the name must be lowercased."

**Source**: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site
**Accessed**: 2025-10-28

### Project Site Repository Structure

**EXACT QUOTE**: "Project sites [...] Stored in a folder within the repository that contains the project's code"

**Source**: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/what-is-github-pages
**Accessed**: 2025-10-28

### Entry File Location

**EXACT QUOTE**: "GitHub Pages searches for an `index.html, index.md, or README.md file as the entry file` at the top level of your publishing source directory."

**Source**: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site
**Accessed**: 2025-10-28

**Additional Requirement for /docs Folder**:
"If your publishing source is a branch and folder, the entry file must be at the top level of the source folder on the source branch. For example, files in the `/docs` folder on the `main` branch would need their entry file positioned there."

**Source**: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site

**Source**: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site
**Accessed**: 2025-10-28

### Folder Structure Options

**EXACT QUOTE**: "Two folder options are available: 1. **Root directory** (`/`) - publishes from the repository root; 2. **Docs folder** (`/docs`) - publishes from a dedicated `/docs` directory on the source branch"

**Source**: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site
**Accessed**: 2025-10-28

### Method 2: GitHub Actions Workflow

**EXACT QUOTE**: "You can write a GitHub Actions workflow to publish your site."

**Source**: https://docs.github.com/en/pages
**Accessed**: 2025-10-28

**Current Recommendation**:
"GitHub Actions is now the recommended deployment approach over the `github-pages` gem"

**Source**: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll
**Accessed**: 2025-10-28

### GitHub Actions Workflow Components

Three key actions are required:

1. **configure-pages**: "This action gathers website metadata and supports deployment from any static site generator"

2. **upload-pages-artifact**: "The artifact must be a compressed gzip archive with a single tar file under 10GB, containing no symbolic or hard links."

3. **deploy-pages**: Requires "a minimum of `pages: write` and `id-token: write` permissions."

**Source**: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site
**Accessed**: 2025-10-28

### Critical Limitation: GITHUB_TOKEN

**FINDING**: "Commits pushed by workflows using `GITHUB_TOKEN` don't trigger GitHub Pages builds"

**Source**: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site
**Accessed**: 2025-10-28

**Implication**: Custom workflows require additional authentication setup to trigger Pages builds.

**Source**: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https
**Accessed**: 2025-10-28

### Certificate Provisioning Process

**EXACT QUOTE**: "When you configure a custom domain: 1. An automatic DNS check begins; 2. GitHub requests a certificate from Let's Encrypt upon successful verification; 3. The certificate is automatically uploaded to TLS termination servers; 4. A checkmark appears once complete"

**Source**: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https
**Accessed**: 2025-10-28

### DNS Requirements for Certificate

**Accessed**: 2025-10-28
