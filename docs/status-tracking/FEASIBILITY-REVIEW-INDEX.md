## 🎯 QUICK REFERENCE

### If You Have 5 Minutes
Read: **PRD-EXEC-SUMMARY.md** (Top to "Recommendation" section)

**Key Takeaway**: Proceed with Phase 1. Resolve 2 blockers before Phase 2. All tech stack is solid.

---

### If You Have 15 Minutes
Read:
1. PRD-EXEC-SUMMARY.md (full)
2. PRD-technical-feasibility-review.md (sections 1-3 only)

**Key Takeaway**: Core technology is verified. Two blockers are about content discovery and repo size, not technology.

---

### If You Have 45 Minutes
Read: All three documents in order:
1. PRD-EXEC-SUMMARY.md (5 min)
2. PRD-technical-feasibility-review.md (25 min)
3. PRD-ACTION-ITEMS.md (15 min)

**Key Takeaway**: Understand all risks, blockers, and what needs to happen before/during implementation.

## 🚨 CRITICAL FINDINGS

### BLOCKER 1: Content Files Not Found ⚠️
- **Issue**: PRD claims `/src/assets/usage/tools/*.md` but files don't exist there
- **Impact**: Blocks Phase 2 (content loading)
- **Reality**: Files are in `/bin/osx-arm64/assets/` (compiled binary)
- **Action**: Locate source files or build extraction script (1-3 hours)
- **Status**: MUST RESOLVE before Phase 2

### BLOCKER 2: Repository Size ⚠️
- **Issue**: Maenifold repo is 3.7GB, GitHub Pages limit is 1GB for published sites
- **Impact**: Deployment could fail if output exceeds 1GB
- **Action**: Configure .gitignore, run test build, measure output (1-2 hours)
- **Status**: MUST RESOLVE before Phase 1 approval

### MEDIUM-RISK 1: Pagefind Compatibility ⚠️
- **Issue**: Pagefind + Next.js 16 + Tailwind 4.0 combination untested
- **Impact**: Phase 7 only, search feature could fail
- **Action**: Test locally before Phase 7 (2-3 hours)
- **Fallback**: Have JSON search ready
- **Status**: Test early, but not blocking

## 🎓 KEY LEARNINGS FROM REVIEW

1. **The good news**: Technology stack is solid and well-documented
2. **The challenge**: Content file discovery is critical blocker
3. **The opportunity**: Early testing (Phase 1) will catch any issues
4. **The discipline**: 8-phase plan is well-structured and prevents scope creep
5. **The reality check**: 3.7GB repo needs cleanup, not a tech problem but operational
