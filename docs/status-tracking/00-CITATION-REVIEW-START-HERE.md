## Issues Found (Minor)

### Issue #1: .nojekyll Attribution ⚠️
- **What**: Quote attribution to template unclear
- **Impact**: LOW - concept verified in official GitHub docs
- **Fix**: Update citation source (optional)

### Issue #2: Tailwind Version ⚠️
- **What**: PRD says v4.0, official shows v4.1
- **Impact**: MINIMAL - configs work with v4.1
- **Fix**: Update to v4.1 (optional)

### Issue #3: Design Choices ⚠️
- **What**: Shiki, Pagefind lack formal citations
- **Impact**: LOW - reasonable architectural decisions
- **Fix**: Add design choice notes (optional)

**None of these prevent implementation.**
