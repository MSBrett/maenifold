## Common Patterns
- **Methodology Selection**: Use ListWorkflows to see options ‚Üí choose appropriate workflow ‚Üí execute with Workflow tool
- **Problem Classification**: Review workflow descriptions to match your problem type to proven methodological frameworks
- **Multi-Methodology Approaches**: Identify complementary workflows for comprehensive analysis (e.g., critical-thinking ‚Üí design-thinking ‚Üí agile)
- **Domain Expertise**: Find specialized workflows for your field (engineering, design, research, management)
- **Orchestration Planning**: Understand which workflows support multi-agent coordination and complex orchestration

## Related Tools
- **Workflow**: Executes the workflows discovered through ListWorkflows - requires exact workflow ID from this tool's output
- **SequentialThinking**: Many workflows embed Sequential Thinking for deep analysis steps - called automatically when workflows specify `requiresEnhancedThinking: true`
- **SearchMemories**: Find previous workflow experiences and results to inform methodology selection
- **WriteMemory**: Preserve successful workflow combinations and methodology insights for future use

## Integration with Maenifold Ecosystem
- **[[Concept]] Extraction**: All workflow responses build the knowledge graph through [[WikiLink]] concepts
- **Persistent Sessions**: Workflow execution maintains state across interaction sessions
- **Tool Orchestration**: Workflows coordinate Maenifold tools (SearchMemories, WriteMemory, BuildContext)
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Advanced workflows support parallel agent dispatch and collaboration
- **Quality Gates**: Workflows include built-in validation checkpoints and guardrails

## Workflow Selection Guidance

### **For Complex Problems**
Choose workflows with `enhancedThinkingEnabled: true` such as:
- design-thinking (user-centered problems)
- critical-thinking (evaluation challenges) 
- strategic-thinking (planning challenges)
- agentic-dev (software development)

### **For Creative Challenges**

- socratic-dialogue for deep understanding

## Troubleshooting
- **"ERROR: Workflows directory not found"** ‚Üí Check Maenifold installation and assets/workflows directory exists
- **Empty Result Array []** ‚Üí No valid workflow files found - verify JSON format in assets/workflows directory  
- **Missing Workflow Descriptions** ‚Üí Some workflow files may lack shortDescription property - workflow will show "No description available"
- **Malformed JSON Skipped** ‚Üí Invalid workflow files are silently skipped but valid workflows continue to load
- **Workflow ID Needed for Execution** ‚Üí Use the exact "id" field from ListWorkflows output in the Workflow tool workflowId parameter

## Advanced Usage Patterns
- **Methodology Chaining**: Use multiple complementary workflows in sequence for comprehensive analysis
- **Problem-Workflow Mapping**: Build decision trees mapping problem types to optimal workflow selections  
- **Orchestration Planning**: Identify workflows supporting multi-agent coordination for complex systematic approaches
- **Quality Control**: Choose workflows with built-in guardrails and validation gates for high-stakes decisions

## Performance Characteristics
- **Fast Discovery**: Instant enumeration of all available methodological frameworks
- **Error Resilient**: Continues processing even if individual workflow files are malformed
- **Memory Efficient**: Loads only workflow metadata, not full step definitions  
- **Format Consistent**: Always returns JSON array suitable for automated processing

ListWorkflows serves as the discovery mechanism for Maenifold's comprehensive methodology catalog, enabling informed selection of structured approaches for systematic problem-solving and complex orchestration challenges.</code></pre>
